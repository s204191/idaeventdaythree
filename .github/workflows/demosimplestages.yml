# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  build:
    # Which image should my job run on? 
    # Could also be Windows 2019 (windows-2019) or macOS Monterey 12 (macos-12)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo This is my first stage!

  StageOne:
    # This stage is dependant of my 'build' job.
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Wow, this is my second stage!

  StageTwo:
    # This can't run unless 'build' AND 'StageOne' have completed.
    # In this case we should only depend on StageOne as it is already dependant of build.
    needs: [build, StageOne]
    # In this setup, I don't dare to go to 'StageTwo' unless Ramtin has approved.
    # So I've created an environment called 'ramtinNeedsToApprove'
    # You can find it at Settings/Environment (note: some prerequisites)
